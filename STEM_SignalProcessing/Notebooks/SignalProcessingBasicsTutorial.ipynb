    "Since the publication of Joseph Fourier’s groundbreaking paper in 1822 [see page 525 in text], the use of the Fourier Series has been widespread in applications of engineering ranging from heat transfer to vibration analysis. And more recently, after the evolution of computation and algorithms, the use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has also become ubiquitous in applications ranging from acoustic analysis to turbulence research and modeling. The notion that sine and cosine waves can be combined to create complex real-world signals is the basis for most of the digital signals that we observe in technology today. In this tutorial, I will describe the basic process for emulating a sampled signal and then processing that signal using the FFT algorithm in Python. This will allow the user to get started with analysis of acoustic-like signals and understand the fundamentals of the Fast Fourier Transform"

    "The phenomena above, when sampling under the Nyquist frequency is called aliasing. Aliasing can obscure measurements and introduce false peaks in data that can result in inaccurate results. This is why we must sample above the highest natural frequency of the system. Of course, some situations do not warrant pre-determined knowledge of the system, but in those cases methods such as time domain filtering can account for such unexpected behavior. Fortunately, in the field of acoustics, we often don’t need to worry about high frequencies above the typical human hearing range (an exception, of course, is in the ultrasonic range). "
